This image processing code defines a C++ class image that handles loading, creating, copying, and saving images using the STB Image library. 
The class supports common file formats like PNG, JPG, BMP, and TGA. It stores image data, dimensions (width and height), and the number of color channels (e.g., RGB).
The code includes multiple constructors: one to load an image from a file, another to create a blank image with specified dimensions, and a copy constructor to duplicate an existing image.
Memory management is handled carefully, with allocated resources being released in the destructor to avoid memory leaks.

Key functions include read for loading image data from a file, write for saving the image to disk in the appropriate format, and getFiletype, which determines the file type based on the file extension.
The main function demonstrates how to use the class by loading an image, saving it under a new name, creating and modifying a copy, and generating a blank image.
Debug and error messages provide feedback during execution, ensuring clarity if an operation fails. This code forms a simple yet flexible framework for basic image processing tasks.
